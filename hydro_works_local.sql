The Eazy Plug is very <a href="https://www.eazyplug.nl/how-to-use/#eazyplugcuttings">easy to use</a>. Just make sure that the plug always can drain the excess water and you cannot overwater it. Because the growing conditions are always optimal, the Eazy Plug creates a very fast and powerful rooting and germination.</p>\n<h4>Germinating seeds</h4>\n<p>Fully moisten the plug and put your seed in the seed hole. Put a thin layer of Eazy Mixx top-layer soil on top of the plug and spray thoroughly with water. Make sure the plug can drain excess water and put it away in a humid and warm environment. Then wait to see the miracle happening. It is that simple!</p>\n<h4>Strike cuttings</h4>\n<p>Fully moisten the plug and put your cutting all the way into the cutting hole. Make sure the Eazy Plug can drain excess water and put it away in a humid and warm environment. No rooting gel or powder is necessary.</p>\n<h4>Easy to transplant</h4>\n<p>The Eazy Plug will always remain firmly bonded together as a whole. This minimises the risk on root damage during sorting, transplanting or replanting, thus preventing the plant from diseases.</p>\n<h4>Limitless shelf life</h4>\n<p>The Eazy Plug is supplied dried, making it clean and lightweight, with limitless shelf life and no risk of mold. It takes water back up very easily and quickly, retaining all of its former characteristics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Eazy Plug® - Characteristics</h4>\n<p>Model : square plug Air-to-water ratio : 20-80</p>\n<p>Size : 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm</p>\n<p>EC : 1.0 * pH : 5.8 *</p>\n<p>Volume : 0.035 L</p>\n<p>Weight dried : 3 grams</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>self regulating</li>\n<li>easy to control</li>\n<li>air pruning for substantial enlargement hair root mass suitable for gradual drier cultivation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n<p>Compatible with all known growing media, like Rock Wool, coir pith, black and white peat, garden soil, potting soil, soil-less mixes, bark fines and wood mulch, sand and grit, wood fibres, perlite, pumice, clay and vermiculite.

Eazy Plugs are self-regulating and will only hold the water they need for an optimum moisture level and an optimum air-to-water ratio. The plug will feel much heavier than Rock-Wool, but that’s normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Take cutting </strong><br />\n<em>For a more detailed explanation of taking cuttings <a href="https://www.eazyplug.nl/taking-clones/">click here</a>.</em><br />\nCut diagonally at a 45 degree angle just below a node or stem swelling, making sure to keep at least 3 nodes above your intersection.<br />\nRemove all but a couple of leaves. <span class="s1">Scrape a little of the outer layer at the bottom of the cutting, but not all around. </span>Cut off ⅓ of the top of remaining big leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Root stimulator</strong><br />\nIf you want to make use of a rooting powder (for example Rhizopon), dip the base of your fresh cut cutting into the rooting powder.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Insertion in Eazy Plug</strong><br />\nInsert the cutting into the Eazy Plug cutting hole. Make sure to insert it deeply enough, completely to the bottom of the cutting hole.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Put into propagator</strong><br />\nPut the tray with Eazy Plug into a propagator.<br />\nClose the lid of the propagator and shut any present air vents to keep the humidity inside the system.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6: Remoistening and fresh air</strong><br />\nOnly remoisten the Eazy Plug after 3 days and keep on doing that every 3 days until the first appearance of roots.<br />\nBriefly open the propagator every day for a little fresh air.<br />\nOpen the air vents slightly at the earliest after 4-5 days. Humidity should remain above 80%, as too much loss of humidity can seriously effect your success rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 7: Assure drainage of excess water</strong><br />\nMake sure Eazy Plug is able to drain excess water at all times, so it can always self-regulate the correct amount of moisture. Never let the bottom of the Eazy Plug touch water, as the moisture absorption of Eazy Plug is exceptionally good and the Eazy Plug will quickly become too wet, which will have a negative effect on the rate of success.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 8: Open air vents</strong><br />\nAfter the first roots have developed, you can gradually open the air vents further in order to acclimate the cutting to a less humid environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 9: Transplant</strong><br />\nIn 7-9 days from start your cutting should have grown its roots throughout the Eazy Plug and it is time to transplant them.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditions for developing roots:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Temperature: The optimum soil temperature for striking roots is 22º Celsius. Above 23º Celsius, you must consider a rise in failure rate.<br />\n2. RH (humidity): RH of 80-95% is perfect. As the cutting needs its energy for striking roots, the moisture level of leaves and stem should remain intact.<br />\n3. Light: In the first few days the cutting will form callus, from which the roots will start to grow. In this phase the cutting only needs tempered light with a broad spectrum (regular assimilation light). After the development of roots the amount of light can be gradually increased.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n	t	<p>Eazy Plug starter plugs are an innovative propagating and growing medium that originates from the Dutch centre of cultivation technology and is truly unique</p>\n	\N

These carbon filters are designed with cutting-edge technology to deliver outstanding performance, making them the ideal choice for every discerning gardener.</p>\n<p>The ProActiv Carbon Filters boast 100% food-grade virgin coconut activated carbon, renowned for its exceptional absorption properties. This premium carbon effectively traps and neutralises odours, leaving your grow space fresh and odour-free. Encased in multi-layer fleece mats, the carbon is securely sealed air-tight on both ends of the scrubber, ensuring maximum efficiency and longevity.</p>\n<p>One standout feature of the ProActiv Carbon Filters is their incredible lightness. Their single-use design further enhances convenience, allowing for easy replacement whenever needed. The hassle-free installation process adds to the appeal, as you can simply clip each end of the filter onto a rope ratchet and attach it to your ducting. No complex setups or specialised tools required!</p>\n<p>Whether you are growing aromatic herbs or other plants with strong scents, the ProActiv Carbon Filters will keep your indoor environment smelling fresh and pleasant.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in a closed-system grow area, these filters come to the rescue by cycling your air through the carbon medium. This not only removes dust, mold spores, and bacteria but also prevents pests like spider mites from infiltrating your precious plants. However, it's essential to note that the ProActiv Carbon Filters are most effective in environments with relative humidity below 85%. Be sure to dehumidify your space to maximise their performance.</p>\n<h4>How match your Garden HighPro ProActiv Carbon Filters up with the correct sized inline fans:</h4>\n<p>1) First, determine how much air-flow your will need through your grow space. If you are using fans to exhaust heat caused by hot HPS grow-lamps, a quick calculation can be done…</p>\n<p>Number of lamps × Watts of each lamp ÷ 2 = Required cubic meters per hour of air flow needed.</p>\n<p>(We recommend adding × 1.2 to this answer for our HOT ZA summers!)</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Find one or more fans</strong> (whichever will best suit your area) that will provide a total airflow =/&gt; than what has been worked out in step 1.</p>\n<p>3) Match up each of your chosen fans with a carbon filter of the <strong>same diameter</strong> (preferably, to avoid the additional cost of ducting reducers). Also check the filter length if installing in cramped spaces.</p>\n<p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT: ALSO make sure that the filter’s air-flow capacity matches or exceeds the fan’s airflow rating, using the ProActive Filter Table Image.</strong> If too much air passes through the filter, it will not be able to scrub the passing air thoroughly!</p>\n	t	<p>Garden HighPro ProActiv Carbon Filters – eliminate unwanted odours and ensure a clean, pest-free environment for your indoor grow area.</p>\n	\N

It has been used for centuries in agriculture and gardening due to its exceptional nutrient content and benefits for plant growth.</p>\n<h4><strong>Benefits of Sea Bird Guano:</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nitrogen Boost:</strong> Fuel your plants with a nitrogen-rich diet, as it boasts exceptionally high nitrogen content. This nutrient is the foundation for vigorous and lush growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Phosphate Powerhouse:</strong> Provide your plants with the essential phosphate they crave. The abundance of phosphate encourages robust root development, flowering, and fruiting.</li>\n<li><strong>Potassium Punch:</strong> Ensure your plants have the potassium they need for overall health and resilience. Delivers a potent dose of potassium, enhancing drought resistance and stress tolerance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How to use Sea Bird Guano in Your Garden:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Soil Assessment:</strong> Begin by assessing your soil's nutrient needs to determine the suitability . It's particularly beneficial for plants requiring a nutrient-rich diet.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Application Calculation:</strong> Calculate the appropriate amount needed for your garden. A general guideline is 1 to 2 tablespoons per square foot (or 30-60 grams per square meter) for most plants.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Even Distribution:</strong> Sprinkle the calculated amount evenly across the soil surface in your garden bed.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Incorporation:</strong> Gently work into the soil using a rake or garden fork, ensuring that the nutrients reach the root zone.</p>\n<p><strong>5.

These vertical fabric pot hangers are not only incredibly strong and long-lasting but also designed for effortless installation, thanks to their metal mounting rings punched through the waterproof canvas backing.</p>\n<p>Crafted with breathable geo-textile fabric, the front potting cavities of these Vertical Wall Pro-pots promote soil aeration and air-pruning, ensuring your plants develop healthier and stronger root systems. Say goodbye to waterlogged roots as the fabric allows the substrate to dry out efficiently, striking the perfect balance between hydration and oxygen supply.</p>\n<p>For optimal results, we recommend using a light Coco Coir and Perlite substrate when filling the pots for planting. This will help avoid the strain caused by heavy, dense potting soils on the mountings of your vertical unit. Additionally, water lightly and more frequently to prevent the weight of fully saturated substrate from putting undue pressure on the mountings.</p>\n<p>To simplify the watering process, you can easily incorporate automation into your vertical wall setup. Install button drippers that connect to your residential irrigation system, ensuring each pot cavity receives the perfect amount of water during your regular watering schedule. Please note that button drippers require a few Bars of water pressure to function effectively, so they may not work with low-pressure water pumps. If you're using a low-pressure water pump for your automated or semi-automated watering system, opt for arrow drippers instead.</p>\n<h5>Dimensions of Canvas backings:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>12Pot: 100cm (H) x 90cm (W)</li>\n<li>8Pot: 100cm (H) x 60cm (W)</li>\n<li>4Pot: 100cm (H) x 30cm (W)</li>\n</ul>\n	t	<p>The Garden HighPro Vertical Wall Pro-pots, Create  a stunning vertical plant wall and optimising your gardening space with ease.</p>\n	\N
